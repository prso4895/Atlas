    <h1>Astronomy</h1>
    <p>
      I have always loved <strong>learning about outer space</strong>. There is so much we <strong>don't know</strong> about it, but I would like to learn as much as I can about <strong>whatever is out there</strong>.

      <a href="https://science.nasa.gov/exoplanets/">Exoplanets</a> is my favorite topic to learn about. I also keep a close eye on
      <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> and like reading about their missions, their research, and their findings.
